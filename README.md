# DisruptCNN
DisruptCNN presents code using the Temporal Convolutional Network (a convolutional neural network with dilated convolutions, see https://github.com/locuslab/TCN) to predict tokamak disruption using raw, high temporal resolution, multi-scale diagnostic data. Specifically, the Electron Cyclotron Emission imaging (ECEi) diagnostic at the DIII-D tokamak was used. Please cite:
